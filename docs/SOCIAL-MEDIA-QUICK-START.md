- ✅ Title and description are perfect for each platform
- ✅ No extra work needed!

### 5. What Visitors See

When someone clicks your campaign link from Instagram:
1. **Welcome Banner** appears at top: "Welcome from Instagram! Get 10% off..."
2. **Social Proof Badge** may show: "45 people from Instagram viewing this page"
3. Their visit is **tracked and stored**
4. If they book, you'll know it came from Instagram

## 📊 Track Your Results

### Where to Check Analytics

Once you add Google Analytics (see main documentation):

1. **Real-time Traffic**: See who's on site right now
2. **Acquisition > Traffic acquisition**: See traffic by source
3. **Engagement > Events**: See share button clicks, social visits
4. **Conversions**: See bookings attributed to campaigns

### Quick Wins to Measure
